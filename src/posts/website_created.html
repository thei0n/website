		<h2>I have a website!</h2>

			<p>As of June 13th 2024, the best website on the internet 
			has officially been created by theion.
			<br>
			<br>
			This site is not made 
			by using one of those fancy and bloated site generators or any garbage like that,
			it was created, quite surprisingly, writing HTML and CSS, like it is supposed to 
			be, tough it is a little inefficient, error-prone and a pain 
			writing HTML and adding boilerplate 
			code to each file, thus it quite probable that I shall write a small program to 
			do that automatically for me in the future, but that program wouldn't be the same as bloated site
			generators, In fact it'd basically be the same as manual way of writing HTML.


			<br>

			Here are some of the advantages of my website compared to a lot of contemporary ones.

			<ul>
				<li>Doesn't fill your entire ram</li>
				<li>Doesn't have ads, tracker or unnecessary JavaScript </li>
				<li>Loads <span class="color1"><strong>Fast</strong></span>!</li>
			</ul>

			
			<p>
			As of now, there isn't that much of content here, but I
			will probably add a lot more.
			</p>
